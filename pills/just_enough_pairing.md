# Just Enough Structure To Pair

Pairing is a very powerful practice for software engineers. There are two
reasons:

1. Two people almost always know more than one and can solve problems more
   effectively than one, **provided they know how to use each other
   effectively.**
2. If you work solo and you are good at it, you will quickly become the expert
   on what you have done. People will come to you to ask questions, slowing both
   of you down. Pairing ensures at least two people know everything.

I have seen very capable engineers burn out due to the last one — be warned!

Here is a short guide on how to pair. There are six steps:

1. [Get to know each other](#step-0-get-to-know-each-other)
2. [Decide where to work](#step-1-decide-where-to-work)
3. [Agree your approach](#step-2-agree-your-approach)
4. [Agree your rhythm](#step-3-agree-your-rhythm)
5. [Pair!](#step-4-pair)
6. [Reflect](#step-5-reflect)

[There's also a video of some real-world pairing if you want to see how it works in industry.](#a-professional-example)

## Step 0: Get to know each other

If you've not worked together recently, ask each other in turn:

1. How do you feel about pairing?
2. What have your experiences in the past been like?

If you have worked together before recently then move on to the next step.

### Step 1: Decide where to work

First, decide on whose code you would like to base your work off of. It is
generally preferable to start with the code of the person who is least far
through the material, otherwise they may be lost.

When you've decided, ensure you are both
[collaborators](just_enough_git.md#add-a-collaborator) on the repository.

### Step 2: Agree your approach

Here is a suggested approach for pairing:

> Driver-navigator pairing involves you both working on the same thing but with
> two separate roles.
> 
> * The Navigator provides instructions to the Driver. They are responsible for
>   managing of the process of programming, the goal, the plan, what is in or
>   out of scope at this moment. They generally shouldn't be typing or looking
>   anything up.
> 
> * The Driver takes instruction and writes code. They are responsible for
>   asking any questions they need to understand what they need to do, looking
>   anything up that the pair needs to know. They should propose things to do
>   where they have an idea, but the navigator makes the decision. They
>   generally shouldn't take action without the navigator's instruction.
> 
> * They are both responsible for delivering quality work, for understanding
>   what they are doing, communicating their thoughts, sharing their knowledge,
>   generating potential solutions, and being considerate of each other.
> 
> This approach is designed to build shared understanding and joint attention
> with full engagement of both partners on the same task. 
> 
> As you gain experience pairing, you can be more flexible on the principles
> above, so long as you are still building shared understanding and joint
> attention.

You can adapt it to what you each prefer, based on open conversation about how
you would like to work. However, you should almost always still prioritise
**shared understanding and joint attention with full engagement of both partners
on the same task**

### Step 3: Agree your Rhythm

**It is vital to take breaks and swap roles regularly.** Pairing is demanding
and if you don't take breaks you are likely to overdo it!

Here is a suggested cycle:

1. Pick someone to drive or navigate at the start.
2. The navigator will set a timer for 25 minutes.
3. Pair-program until the timer goes off.
4. Take a 5 minute break.
5. Swap driver-navigator roles and return to step 2.

If you have previously worked well together and are in the zone, it's OK to up
your phase time from 25m to perhaps 45m. Watch out for fatigue and frustration.

Some of these cycles might not involve much or any programming. Sometimes you'll
just be talking things through. That's OK!

### Step 4: Pair!

Feel free to take longer breaks, especially if one of you gets confused or
stressed.

## Step 5: Reflect

At the end of the day, ask each other:

> 1. On a scale of 1-10, how much did you understand what we did today?
> 2. On a scale of 1-10, how engaged did you feel in our work today?

You can then have a short discussion about why. It doesn't need to be perfect
every time, everyone has bad pairing sessions.

## A Professional Example

If you'd like to get an idea of what pairing is like for experienced engineers,
[here is a composite video of a coach (Kay) and an engineer (Rainer)
pairing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KdWFxNqei8). It's a long watch, so
mark it for a quiet time.

Note that:

* They spend some time setting up the session and getting to know how each other
  works.
* Neither of them are perfect pairs. There are moments of confusion and
  misalignment.
* They place a lot of time on communication, building shared understanding of
  the system and joint attention on the task.
