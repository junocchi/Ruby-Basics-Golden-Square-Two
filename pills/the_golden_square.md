# The Golden Square

_[A video summary is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHkVhq5R0_8&t=0s)_

The Golden Square refers to four software engineering practices:

1. Test-Driving (TDD)
2. Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
3. Debugging
4. Pairing

With strong skills in each of these areas, you will be able to do a great deal
of useful work as an engineer.

This document briefly describes each one, its purpose, and motivation.

## Test-Driving

Test-driving is a method for creating software that involves:

1. Deciding what you want the software to do.
2. Writing tests to check that it does that.
3. Writing the code to pass those tests.

It is called test-driven development because you write the tests first and then
focus on making them pass. The tests 'drive' the implementation.

There are a number of reasons people do this. One key reason to test-drive is
because it structures your programming approach and reduces your mental load.

## Object-Oriented Design

Object-oriented design is a way of structuring code using objects and classes.
The software is created by creating a system of classes that interact to perform
the job of the software. 

Classes are blueprints for objects, and objects encapsulate ('wrap') values
('state' or 'memory'), providing methods that control access to those values and
do useful work.

Structuring programs is very important because programs can get very large and
hard to understand. If you don't break them down into small parts each with a
particular job they become expensive and time-consuming to maintain.

There are a number of approaches to structuring programs. OOD is the most
popular.

## Debugging

Debugging is the name for a collection of different approaches for dealing with
the situation when the code does something you don't intend it to for reasons
you don't understand.

It is important because code is complex and people rarely get it totally right.
Most of the ways they get it wrong are subtle and hard to figure out. Good
debugging skills help an engineer discover the source of defects ('bugs') and
thereby correct them.

## Pairing

Pair programming, or pairing, is two programmers working on the same thing at
the same time. Some teams do pairing 100% of the time, most do it some of the
time, and some never do it.

It is useful because it can apply two minds and two sets of knowledge to the
same problem, and because it spreads knowledge around a team. As an engineer,
knowledge of the system is a very valuable thing, and so pairing makes the whole
team more effective.
