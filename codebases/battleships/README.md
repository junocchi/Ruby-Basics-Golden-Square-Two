# Battleships Project

This is a project aimed to develop all of your skills so far. **It is designed
to be challenging for most learners on the Makers immersive course.**

Your assignment is to design and test-drive a terminal-based Battleships game. A
small amount of code is already written, to get you started and show you the
approach to building and testing terminal user-interfaces using mocking.

## Getting Started

How to get started:

```shell
; bundle install
; rspec # all tests should pass
; ruby run.rb # This will give you a few prompts and then an error
```

You might want to start by reading through the existing code, and then
test-driving out the `Game` class to the point where running `ruby run.rb` gets
to the end of its sequence without any errors.

After that, pick a few user stories from below, design your classes, and start
test-driving.

## User Stories

Here are the user stories to implement:

```
As a player
So that I can prepare for the game
I would like to place a ship in a board location

As a player
So that I can play a more interesting game
I would like to have a range of ship sizes to choose from

As a player
So the game is more fun to play
I would like a nice command line interface that lets me enter ship positions and
shots using commands (rather than using IRB to interact with objects)

As a player
So that I can create a layout of ships to outwit my opponent
I would like to be able to choose the directions my ships face in

As a player
So that I can have a coherent game
I would like ships to be constrained to be on the board

As a player
So that I can have a coherent game
I would like ships to be constrained not to overlap

As a player
So that I can win the game
I would like to be able to fire at my opponent's board

As a player
So that I can refine my strategy
I would like to know when I have sunk an opponent's ship

As a player
So that I know when to finish playing
I would like to know when I have won or lost

As a player
So that I can consider my next shot
I would like to be able to see my hits and misses so far

As a player
So that I can play against a human opponent
I would like to play a two-player game
```
